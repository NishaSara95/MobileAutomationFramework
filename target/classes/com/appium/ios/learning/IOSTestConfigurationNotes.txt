----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to official appium website and download https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases .dmg file and download appium server

Appium server
Host number: 0.0.0.0
Port number : 4723

2.Install X code from app store and this is a developer tool editor to code IOS apps used  by developer

To install any app in your iphone you need to compile the code and get .app file which need to be deployed in your iphone

After successful compilation with the required iphone version we will get the simulator (virtual iphone) with the app inside the phone 

3. For IOS automation we need XCUI Test driver that needs to be installed using the command in cmd: 'appium driver install xcuitest'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IOS Real Device Automation :

In terminal run the below commands
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew install libimobiledevice

brew install ios-deploy


Four  new Capabilities are needed to run the Tests on real Device :

d.setCapability("xcodeOrgId","xxxxxxxx");  // Provided by the team
d.setCapability("xcodeSigningId","iPhone Developer");   // Default iphone developer
d.setCapability("udid","xxxxxxxx");   // Provided by team or can be retrieved by QA
d.setCapability("updateWDABundleId","xxxxxxx"); // Provided by the team


How to get the xcodeOrgId?
It is TeamID  generated by Apple.You can find your Team ID using your developer account. Sign in to developer.apple.com/account, and click Membership in the sidebar.
 Your Team ID appears in the Membership Information section under the team name

What is updateWDABundleId?
Often we need provisioning profile from Apple to run the apps on Real Devices.And this Provisioning Profile generates Bundle ID
And we need to Sign the App to run on the device using Bundle id.

Connect your Device.
